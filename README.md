## Fullstack Template: Nest.js and Next.js
This repository serves as a comprehensive template for developing a fullstack application. The backend, built with Nest.js, offers a RESTful API structured with a modular architecture. The database integration is powered by MySQL through Prisma. The backend further encompasses features such as robust authentication mechanisms (JWT, OAuth, etc.), thorough error handling, and validation. Additionally, global response handling is implemented to streamline communication with the frontend.

### Backend Features
- RESTful API with Modular Architecture:
The backend is structured with a modular and scalable architecture, providing a RESTful API for seamless communication with the frontend.

- MySQL Database with Prisma:
Database integration is accomplished using MySQL in conjunction with Prisma, offering an efficient and type-safe query building for database operations.

- Authentication:
The backend includes robust authentication mechanisms, supporting JWT, OAuth, and other industry-standard methods to ensure secure user interactions.

- Error Handling and Validation:
Comprehensive error handling and validation mechanisms are implemented to enhance the reliability and security of the application.

- Global Response Handling:
Global response handling is in place, streamlining the interaction between the backend and frontend, ensuring consistent and standardized responses.

### Frontend Features
- State Management:
The frontend utilizes Redux Toolkit for state management, providing a predictable and centralized state container for the application.

- Routing and Navigation:
Seamless navigation and routing are implemented to enhance the user experience, ensuring smooth transitions between different views within the application.

- Material-UI (MUI):
The frontend is styled using Material-UI (MUI), a popular React UI framework, offering a cohesive and visually appealing design.

- Authentication:
Authentication on the frontend is seamlessly integrated with the backend, providing a secure and user-friendly login and authentication experience.

- API Integration:
The frontend interacts seamlessly with the backend through well-defined API integrations, ensuring efficient communication and data exchange.
